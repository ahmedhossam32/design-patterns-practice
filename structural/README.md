# ðŸ§± Structural Design Patterns

This folder contains implementations of core **Structural Design Patterns** in Java.

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are **composed** to form larger structures, while keeping them **flexible** and **efficient**.

Each pattern is implemented in its own subfolder with clean code, realistic examples, and a dedicated `README.md`.

---

## âœ… Patterns Included

- **Adapter** â€“ Convert one interface to another expected by the client.
- **Bridge** â€“ Separate abstraction from implementation so they can evolve independently.
- **Composite** â€“ Treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Decorator** â€“ Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Facade** â€“ Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight** â€“ Share objects to support large numbers efficiently.
- **Proxy** â€“ Control access to objects by acting as a substitute or placeholder.

---

Each subfolder demonstrates a **real-world use case** with:

- âœ… Interface or abstract base
- âœ… Concrete implementations
- âœ… Main runner class to test it
- âœ… A clear `README.md` explaining how and why the pattern is applied

ðŸ“Œ Structural patterns improve:

- **Code organization**
- **Readability**
- **Scalability**
- **Maintainability**

They are especially helpful in **GUI systems**, **networking**, **frameworks**, and **middleware design**.

ðŸ§  Mastering these patterns helps you build flexible and modular architectures â€” a must for backend developers and software engineers.
