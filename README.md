# 🎯 Design Patterns Practice in Java

This repository contains hands-on Java implementations of commonly used **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**, organized by category:  
- ✅ **Creational** (Completed)  
- 🛠️ Structural (In Progress)  
- 🔜 Behavioral (Coming Soon)

Each folder contains real-world exercises, use cases, and full working code — ready to run and explore.

## ✅ What's Inside

| Category     | Status     | Patterns Included                          |
|--------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Creational   | ✅ Complete | Singleton, Builder, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Prototype, Simple Factory |

## 📌 Goal

The goal is to practice and demonstrate understanding of each design pattern with:
- Real-world analogies
- Clean code structure
- GitHub-ready documentation (`README.md` in each pattern folder)
