# üè≠ Simple Factory Pattern ‚Äì Notification System

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates the **Simple Factory Pattern** through a basic notification system.  
A central factory method creates different types of notifications (Email, SMS, Push) based on input,  
decoupling the creation logic from the client code.

## üß± Structure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Notification` | Interface representing a general notification |
| `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, `PushNotification` | Concrete notification types |
| `NotificationFactory` | Simple factory class that returns appropriate notification |
| `Main` | Client code that uses the factory to send notifications |

## ‚úÖ Features

- Centralized object creation logic
- **Reduces coupling** between client and concrete classes
- Easily extendable for new types of notifications
- Simple and practical design for real-world systems
